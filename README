----------------------------------------------------------

This is the buildsystem for the Bunkerschild B-OS, based upon OpenWrt/LEDE.

To build the Bunkerschild firmware you need a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack
of a case sensitive file system.

You need gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make, find, grep, diff,
unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers installed.

1. Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to obtain all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks for all obtained
packages into package/feeds/

3. Run "make menuconfig" to select your preferred configuration for the
toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run "make" to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build
the cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the Linux kernel & all
chosen applications for your target system.

Bunkerschild B-OS is a fork of lede-project/source, but has it's own ecosystem.
So, the feed URL's are also pointing to the Bunkerschild sources at GitHub and
not to those, LEDE or OpenWRT makes use of. Also Bunkerschild B-OS points in a 
different direction and has another target. The goal of Bunkerschild B-OS is to
be a fast, secure and stable managed firmware for different devices.
